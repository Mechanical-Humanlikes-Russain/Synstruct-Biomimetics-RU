# Description
A mod using Artificial Beings Framework (ABF) and Synstructs Core (ABF:SC) to bring synstruct biomimetics to RimWorld. Synstructs have long been integrated into human societies, inheriting a proclivity toward domestication and adopting lesser-intelligence creatures. Being purely mechanical, synstructs take a much simpler approach than the slow process of selective breeding: they just manufacture their own pets and livestock.


## Features
* Five races of animal-intelligence synstruct models for production:
    * The chemstruct, a mimic of the humble chicken. Chemstructs consume the fatty material of meat in order to produce chemical capsules that can be processed at a biofuel refinery into neutroamine or chemfuel. Those products are necessary for coolant and lubricant, making them essential for self-sufficient synstruct societies.
    * The convoystruct, a mimic of the humble tortoise. Convoystructs are hardy drones designed to be long-range convoy carriers and haulers. As they require no organic matter to process, convoystructs can charge. They form the backbone of any synstruct society's transportation logistics.
    * The guardstruct, a mimic of the humble guard dog. Guardstructs are fast, powerful drones designed for combat and reconnaissance. They also, curiously, are often found as companions and "pets," with special programming implemented to try and minimize any accidental injuries caused to civilians or allies that makes them seem affectionate. As they require no organic matter to process, guardstructs can charge.
    * The nutristruct, a mimic of the humble cow. Nutristructs consume raw organic matter in order to produce a vastly more nutritive substance that can be further processed into a food that never expires. A somewhat uncommon synstruct to find in their own societies, these biomimetics are adored in human societies for just how efficient they can be.
    * The steelstruct, a mimic of the humble sheep. Steelstructs consume organic matter in order to refine the trace minerals into steel. They are ravenous, but quite valued by synstruct societies that are awash in organic matter they have no use for.
* Research and recipes to unlock and manufacture the models.
* A race of exceedingly simple flying drone ejected from a shell that can be manufactured for use in mortars or traps. These razorstructs will seek out anything nearby to shred to pieces - with no regard for friends, foes, or neutral entities.
